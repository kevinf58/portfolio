          Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of independent and collaborative projects to grow as a
          developer and challenge myself. Each of the cards below offers a closer look at my development
          journey - sharing the reasoning behind my decisions, any challenges I encountered, and the
          lessons I learned throughout the process of building each project. Here are a few that I’m
          particularly proud of.
